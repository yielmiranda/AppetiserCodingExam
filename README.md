# AppetiserCodingExam

Please see list bbelow for some information regarding the application:
  - Was built using Xcode 11.4.1
  - Used Core Data for data management
  - Used Storyboards and Xibs for the interface
  - Used MVVM architecture with RxSwift so I can apply SOLID principles of OOP to ensure that the app is easier to maintain and extend, and be more adaptive to future changes
